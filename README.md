Why?
---
Each time I start using a new linux box , it used to take me some time
to adjust the work environment to my liking.
At first I tried keeping these files on Dropbox, but Dropbox is blocked
from corporate firewalls, so when I work at my client's office 
on a machine they provided, I couldn't access my customizations.

github seemed like a good idea so that others too can reuse by setup if needed.

Current Setup
-------------

 * Shell : zsh , Shifted recently from bash
 * Editor : Vim
 * tmux : Terminal Multiplexer, Must have when working with remote systems.

Doom Config
-----------

`~/doom-emacs` contains the doom emacs cloned from the repo.

`~/doom-config` has the configuration.

I've setup DOOMDIR to point to `~/doom-config`
